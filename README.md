# Proj_03A_Logistic_Regression_Purchase_Data

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a person will buy a new car or not. It utilizes social network advertising data, where each user’s age and estimated salary are given as features.

Purpose
Goal: The company wants to identify target customers for their new car brand so that advertisements can be shown specifically to those most likely to buy.

Main Features:
Load and process the data (based on age and estimated salary)
Scale the features (using StandardScaler)
Split the data into training and testing sets
Train the Logistic Regression model and measure its accuracy
Create a Confusion Matrix and calculate the accuracy score
Visualize the data and model predictions (scatter plots and decision boundary)

How to Use: 

Place the Purchase_Logistic.csv file with the project.

Run the code in Python (make sure pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, and matplotlib are installed).

When you run the code, you will get:

A scatter plot of the data

Visualization of the Logistic Regression decision boundary

Confusion matrix and accuracy score, so you can see the model’s performance
